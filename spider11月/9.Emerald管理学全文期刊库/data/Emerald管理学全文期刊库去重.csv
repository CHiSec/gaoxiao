Brewer, Kenneth J. Button, David A. Hensher","2008","The quality of transport logistics is now recognized as being vital to the success of many organisation. The ability to transport goods quickly, safely, economically and reliably is seen as vital to a nation’s prosperity and capacity to compete in a rapidly globalising economy. Logistics has advanced significantly during the past twenty years as companies have appreciated the gains from such initiatives as limiting inventories, making use of ‘seamless’ distribution services, and taking advantage of advances in telecommunication and information technologies. Institutional changes, such as deregulation and privatization, have in many countries led to contexts in which these changes could take place. The integration of transportation into the production process through advanced information systems and the application of modern management techniques is now at the centre of logistics.This volume, the second in the series of Handbook in Transport, contains commissioned refereed papers that cover the main elements of transport logistics. The authors were selected from around the world and asked to provide critiques of their subject areas as well as a review of the state of the art and case study examples. These up-to-date contribution cover all the main areas of transport logistics, providing those in the field with current information whilst at the same time offering easy access for those who are new to the field and are seeking review material.","Part 1: Globalization and International Perspectives;Part 2: Supply Chain Management;Part 3: Logistics Mangament;Part 4: Customer Service;Part 6: Organizational Logistics;Part 7: Comparative Industry Approaches;Part 8: Research Management","Handbooks in Transport","1472-7889","David A.

The first part is about Professor Marvin L. Manheim and his path breaking contributions to transportation. The main chapter, written by him, is based on the keynote presentation he delivered at the opening session of the 1998 World Conference on Transport Research in Antwerp. It presents his vision for the role of ICTs in transport; a vision that was revolutionary in 1998 and is still valid and relevant today. The first part also includes an overview written by his widow and collaborator, Mary-Beth Manheim, describing his scientific contributions. The remainder of the book, parts two and three, is about freight transport modeling and policy, and presents an application of Manheim's TSA paradigm","PART 1 PROF. MARVIN L.

Sheldon, Cathy H. C. Hsu","2018","Tourism in Cuba: Casinos, Castros, and Challenges presents an in-depth exploration of the history and development of tourism in Cuba. Beginning with the earliest days of prohibition in the US, Tony L. Henthorne illustrates how Cuba strove to position itself as an uninhibited Caribbean playground for the well-heeled American traveler.This book analyzes the ways in which Cuban tourism reached previously unimagined economic heights through the “new normal” of casinos, nightclubs, and prostitution during Fulgencio Batista’s reign, and it examines the forces sustaining his rise to power.Fidel Castro’s revolution set out to end Batista’s reign of corruption, promising a new beginning for Cuba and the Cuban people. Casinos were shuttered, and the other hedonistic trappings of decadence quickly vanished; relations between the US and Cuba were severed, and the island began a long transformative relationship with the Soviet Union. This book provides an illuminating insight into the impact of these social and economic changes upon tourism in Cuba.Henthorne goes on to explore Barack Obama’s significant travel and economic concessions to Cuba, which resulted in a soar in tourism, and he evaluates how Donald Trump has since scaled back on US overtures to Cuba. He also provides an insider’s look at the Cuban tourist product – what it was, what it is, and what it may be in the future.","Part I Casinos;Part II Castros;Part 3 Challenges","Tourism Social Science Series","1571-5043","Jafar Jafari","Tourism & Hospitality","2042-678X","Tourism & Hospitality"

It is divided into four parts, Setting the Stage: Acceptability Problem, European Research Results, Behind Public Acceptability: Relevant Determinants, and Political Acceptability, and tackles several relevant parts from a theoretical as well as from a practical viewpoint by asking questions like: how to explain the different levels of public acceptability of various travel demand management measures? Which factors influence the level of acceptability? How to deal with political acceptability problems? What should future implementation approaches look like from the point of view of acceptability?","","","","","","",""

Which factors influence the level of acceptability? How to deal with political acceptability problems? What should future implementation approaches look like from the point of view of acceptability?","","Transport and Sustainability","2044-9941","Stephen Ison, Maria Attard and Jon Shaw","Transport,","1750-6220","Transport,"

The second half clarifies how such national policies are reflected in the actual financial resources. Here, after a detailed review of the financial systems related to transportation in various countries, a methodology for an international comparison of financial resources for the improvements of transportation systems is shown.","","Transport and Sustainability","2044-9941","Stephen Ison, Maria Attard and Jon Shaw","Transport,","","Transport,"
