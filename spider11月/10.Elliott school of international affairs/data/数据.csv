Hopkins is a specialist in modern South Asian history, in particular that of Afghanistan, as well as British imperialism. His research focuses on the role of the colonial state in creating the modern states inhabiting the region.

Through intensive recording, transcription and analysis of ritual performances, he examined how the mastery and use of a parallelistic style of ceremonial discourse established the cultural authority of individuals, lineages and sacred spaces. Beginning in 1990's, he analyzed the role of language ideologies in the rapid decline of ritual speech on Sumba, and the rise of the Indonesian national language as the language political and religious authority. Since 2000, he has carried out extensive video ethnographic analyses of the use of authoritative language in psychiatric clinics, Indonesian courtrooms, and U.S. science classrooms."

Her research perspective acknowledges clear opportunities for agency by firms’ managers as they seek to build capabilities, anticipate rivals’ strategic actions, and deliberately influence the development of the institutional environment to serve their firm’s best interests. Simultaneously, her theoretical perspective builds from the observation that the institutional diversity present across the world raises critical challenges for firms, whose strategic decisions and actions are often embedded in multiple national environments.,Many of Professor Spencer’s research questions focus on firm-level innovation and investment strategies—issues that are at the heart of a country’s economic growth, and contribute powerfully to the competitiveness of individual firms.  How do national institutional structures affect the dynamics of new technology emergence, the investment and innovation strategies of firms, and the effectiveness of governments’ technology policies?  In what ways do firms’ strategies affect the diffusion of technological knowledge among firms, the nature of strategic interaction among rivals, and the development of the institutional environment?  Much of her recent research centers on the institutional environments present in developing countries, with an emphasis on MNE investment and entrepreneurship in those economies.,Professor Spencer has published articles in the top journals in the management, strategy, and international business fields, including ,Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Strategic Management Journal, Organization Science ,and ,Journal of International Business Studies."

Here he is in particular interested in how the interaction of various political actors, whose legitimacy (e.g. voter support) continues to be dependent on war-time – mainly ethno-national – loyalties, can create a new peacetime working order. To highlight potential threats resulting from the ways political powers are created in Bosnia today, he analyzes how political agents use central public spaces as a stage and prop to justify, legitimize, and mobilize their constituents in reference to various ethno-national myths, symbols, and rituals. What his research on intergroup interactions in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrates so far is that the current justifications of power pose serious threat to the overall social order of Bosnia; increasingly so since economic decline and reductions in international aid elevate war-time profiteers and logics once again.","Dr. rer. pol.
